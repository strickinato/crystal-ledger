# A Crystal Ledger Parser

I've never written a parser before. I looked at this article: https://www.blackbytes.info/2015/04/parsing-with-ruby/ and translated what I think I needed into Crystal. I was able to then use this to write a simple script to completely deduplicate all my transactions that I stupidly duplicated and sorted!
